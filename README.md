# Calculator

This is a Repo for the calcultor made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Objective

The Objective of the project is to make an on-screen calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript putting to practice everything I learned so far on the foundations path.

## Project Reflections

For the javascript part I used some switches as I had never used them and wanted to practice it.

For the HTML/CSS I used some grids because I always used flexbox on all other projects.

## Future

- Correct some bugs on the javascript code
- Continue to Improve the UI
- Add keyboard support
